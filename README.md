# 3D model - Parametric Window F-Lock

## Model origin and licesce

This model is heavily inspired by [Window lock // Fensterarretierung](https://www.printables.com/model/102126-window-lock-fensterarretierung) designed by [WVRPrinter](https://www.printables.com/@WVRPrinter_146394). It was originally licensed under CC-BY-NC and I decided to treat my inspired work as remix.

## Idea

It's a simple attachment for standard tilt windows aimed at preventing window slamming during strong drafts. One of main goals of general design was to have it easy to attach and detach without any impact on window.

Additionaly, this model is fully parametric, thus easy to adjust for most of standard windows.
